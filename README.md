# THIS IS WHO I AM

A **young** professional with good attitude and willingness to work in the **web development** sector, to acquire more experience and knowledge.

I like the self-taught aproach, but the academic side is also good. I usually learn in tandem with those two.

## My interests

I have interests in many areas but I will break it down into 2 main ones. Profesional focus ones and personal focus.

### Profesional

I am interested in web development because I have a background on painting, editing and graphic design. The main area being the front-end.

Also I like the back-end part, but mainly because I want to acquire programming knowledge in general, and in this area it seems to be the best for programming best practices and performance.

I like videogames and I am learning how to program them, but this is something more for the long run.

Some languages and frameworks I know are:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Java
  - C# (learned for Unity3D)
  - Go (currently learning it)
  - C/C++ (currently learning them)
  - Node
  - Astro
  - Next
  - React

### Personal

I like drawing and painting, also editing photos and videos as well as taking them. I am currently training boxing and I enjoy going for a walk everyday. Sometimes I go for a walk with my dog, but she is a bit old now so she doesn't want to go for a long distance.

I also like animation and learning how to animate. Since I was a kid I am being impressed by the worlds that animation, 2D or 3D, can create and how the music makes you feel like you are there.

I am learning how to play drums at the moment. I am a bit of a metalhead, but what drove me to this were the 80's rock.

## Languages I speak

| Language     | Level         |
|--------------|---------------|
| Spanish      | Native        |
| English      | Cambridge B2  |
| Portuguese   | A1            |

> **NOTE**: The levels are a reference based on Europe's language system, from A to C (C being the highest)
>
> Basically in each letter it could be a 1 or a 2, C2 in theory equals to a native speaker
